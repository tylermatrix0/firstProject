# Introduction

Fresh Tomatoes is a static site displaying 6 movies with a title, summary, and trailer on clicking the poster image.
The only functionality on the site is clicking on the image and a modal pops out linking to a YouTube link for the specific movie's trailer.


# Features
Responsive web design and jquery animations.
Modal pops out a video player for individual movie trailers.

# How to use
Simply download the code and change the hardcoded values found in the entertainment_center.py file. The arguments for the movie class are a title, summary, poster image link, and the trailer link.
After you've hardcoded the movie you want in the format repeated, add the variable name to the movies array and the fresh_tomatoes.py will do the rest of the work.
